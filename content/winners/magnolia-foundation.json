    "description": "Access to information and resources is critical in any crisis. Making sure that both are available as quickly as possible in case of an emergency can save lives. Technology can help scale almost instantaneously every effort of intervention if deployed correctly. Having a shared common infrastructure among actors working in the field helps with reducing duplication of efforts, effective distribution of resources, accessing verified and trustworthy data, managing activities and supporting large numbers of beneficiaries simultaneously. Last but not least, it also means safety and standards. In such situations making sure you have the right technology at hand is essential. Our ecosystem is built open-source, making sure that all of the security, accessibility and inclusivity standards are followed in order to service every person as best as possible and reducing vulnerability to the best of its capacity.",

Since we began our work in mid-2019, our goal has been to advocate for holistic peace in which we incorporate inner, social, ecological, and political harmony. The School of Peace, is a pedagogical space that offers innovative concepts and tools for peacebuilding. Our School of Peace is the expression of the changes we collectively yearn for in the world. Our courses propose new ways of thinking and acting as community members through exchanged discussions held on digital platforms. We conceive peace as a habit developed and practiced in all dimensions of life. So far, we have reached countries such as Bangladesh, Syria, Yemen, Guatemala, Colombia, Nigeria, United States, Argentina, Chile, and Germany, among others.  Using technology, we aim to inspire and empower our participants worldwide by providing them with tools and helping them continue consolidating peace in their respective communities."
